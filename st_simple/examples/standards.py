# This is tedious, you need to set any of this properties for each component and we need to know the behavior of the component
# before hand. So we can use a ´Standard´  which is a class that contains the representation of the component and
# the behavior of the component. So each component we add to the app page will have the same behavior as the standard.
# The standard is a class that contains the representation of each component and the behavior of the component.

# First we need to create a canvas(AppPage,AppFragment,AppDialog) and then we can define the standard that the canvas will use.

# in this case, the button will be stateful and fatal by default.
